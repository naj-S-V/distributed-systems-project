# 🚀 Distributed Systems Project — Scalable URL Shortener

This repository contains the **Distributed Systems Project (2025)** — a scalable **URL Shortener** application deployed on a **Kubernetes cluster** with full CI/CD automation.

The goal is to demonstrate a professional-grade infrastructure that includes:
- Multi-environment pipeline (**Dev → Test → Prod**)
- **MongoDB sharded & replicated** database
- **Zero-downtime deployments**
- **Monitoring and scaling** via Kubernetes Dashboard
- **Schema migration** demonstration directly from the web interface

## 🧠 Quick Start (Local Dev)

```bash
# Start Minikube
minikube start --cpus=4 --memory=8192

# Deploy MongoDB cluster and the app in dev namespace
kubectl apply -f k8s/db/mongodb-sharded.yaml -n dev
kubectl apply -f k8s/db/init-mongo-job.yaml -n dev
kubectl apply -f k8s/dev/ -n dev

# Access the app
minikube service scalable-app -n dev
```
